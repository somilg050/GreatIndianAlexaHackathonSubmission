# Alexa_Skill-Great_Indian_Hackathon

Young minds learn best when taught in an interactive fashion. Also, they love to hear animated voices more than ordinary human voices or even Alexa's voice. Our skill considers these factors and presents a character, Simba, for them to explore countries and learn about festivals with. The skill is targeted towards 3-9-year-old children. The skill is designed in a way that childer can learn on their own, or parents can invoke the skill and walk through it with their children.

Once the user launches the skill by saying, "Open Simba Safari", he/she can use it in two ways-
1. Interactive mode that helps them learn about festivals.
2. Interactive mode of exploring countries and learning about them.

If the user wishes to explore a country, Alexa randomly selects a country for the user to explore or explore one of the user's choice.
If the user wishes to learn about festivals, Alexa randomly selects a festival to learn or starts with one of the user's choice.
Our primary goal is to teach children while playing an interactive game cause we believe that how they learn best.
After this campaign is over, we are planning on adding more interactive chapters, so the user had a more extensive range of countries and festivals to choose from. Also, we want to expand the skill to include chapters that teach basic maths and science in a similar fashion.
